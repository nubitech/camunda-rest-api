**orQueries** | [**[HistoricTaskInstanceQueryDto]**](HistoricTaskInstanceQueryDto.md) | A JSON array of nested historic task instance queries with OR semantics.  A task instance matches a nested query if it fulfills at least one of the query&#x27;s predicates.  With multiple nested queries, a task instance must fulfill at least one predicate of each query ([Conjunctive Normal Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form)).  All task instance query properties can be used except for: &#x60;sorting&#x60;, &#x60;withCandidateGroups&#x60;, &#x60; withoutCandidateGroups&#x60;.  See the [User Guide](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/develop/user-guide/process-engine/process-engine-api/#or-queries) for more information about OR queries. | [optional] 
**sorting** | [**[HistoricTaskInstanceQueryDtoSorting]**](HistoricTaskInstanceQueryDtoSorting.md) | An array of criteria to sort the result by. Each element of the array is                     an object that specifies one ordering. The position in the array                     identifies the rank of an ordering, i.e., whether it is primary, secondary,                     etc. Sorting has no effect for &#x60;count&#x60; endpoints | [optional]
